auth_title = "TWAS THE BREASTFEEDER’S NIGHTTIME\nBy Andi Silverman, www.mamaknowsbreast.com\n(original by Clement Moore)\n(edited by Alouise Quiatchon)"

content = "Twas a holiday eve and the babe was asleep,\nSwaddled tight in her crib she made not a peep.\nMy boobs were depleted from feeding all day.\n'Please don’t wake. Sleep all night,' to the babe I did pray.\nBut her lips, how they moved, as she lay in her bed.\nVisions of milky breasts danced in her head.\nDad in his boxer-briefs and I in my sweats,\nCould we get some shuteye? Go ahead, place your bets.\nThe moon on the breast of my t-shirt did glow,\nGave a luster to leaking spots set to grow.\nMy nursing pads were soaked, they fell out of place.\nMy bra had unsnapped. How I missed sexy lace.\nFor months I’d been feeding our babe everywhere.\nCar seat, parking lots, shops, anywhere.\nAll my modesty gone, nothing shy anymore.\nIf the kiddo was crying, I knew how to score.\nAnd now with the holidays, things often got dire.\nWhile out buying gifts, I sometimes drew ire.\nI'd go out in sweats, make-up, oh nay.\nWhile my sister sassed, ‘Is that what you’re wearing today?’\nWhen from the babe’s room there arose such a clatter.\nWe sprang from our bed to see what was the matter.\nAway to her room we flew with a flash,\nThrew open the door, in the dark I did crash.\nWhat a klutz I can be, ‘twas those bags made me fall.\nSacks for our trip, all arranged in the hall.\nWe were going to our parents’, a ten minute drive.\nHoliday time—Will I make it alive?\nOne big huge duffle held all the babe’s stuff.\nDiapers, wipes, onesies. Did I bring enough?\nNow don’t forget burp cloths, crib sheets and toys.\nBooks and Bjorn, we’ll exhibit such poise.\nOn breast pump, on bottles, on stroller and boppy.\nOn car seat, on cradle, on blanket and binky.\nFill the back of the car, fill the trunk with our haul.\nAnd we’ll drive away, drive away, drive away all.\nNow don’t forget stopping to feed long the way.\nGas stations, McDonalds and rest stops, oy vey.\nOf course there’ll be lots of those diapers to do.\nGet out the Purell, you’ll be covered in poo.\nWhen we finally arrive, now what will await?\nLots of food and embraces, it’ll be really great.\nNo, no one will not fight. I will not shed a tear.\nOk, a white lie— but rejoice in who’s here.\nAnd what about wine or a champagne or two?\nWill it make my milk bad? Old wives tale or true?\nAnd will anyone say, “Can she now take a bottle?”\n'How long will you breastfeed?' How these questions can throttle.\nNow back to that “clatter,” the babe and that noise.\nWe had rushed right on in, leaping over the toys.\nWhen what to our wondering eyes did appear,\nOur babe still asleep, oh how sweet, oh how dear.\nHer cheeks, how they glistened, her hair soft and furry.\nAnd I smiled when I saw her, despite all my worry.\nHow delicious, her belly, moving in and then out.\nHow precious, her lips in a sweet little pout.\nShe had not woken up! she did not need to eat.\nShe had had quite enough, her day quite complete.\nAnd so back to our bed we did quietly crawl.\nHappy Holidays to one, happy sleeping to all."
